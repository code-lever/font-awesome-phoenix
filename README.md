If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add font_awesome_phoenix to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:font_awesome_phoenix, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure font_awesome_phoenix is started before your application:

          [applications: [:font_awesome_phoenix]]
        end
